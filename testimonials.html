								<p><i>As Co-Founder and CEO, I had the privilege of working closely with Nick and witnessed firsthand his exceptional abilities as a technology leader and data strategist.

									Nick's expertise in data science and analytics proved invaluable as we developed and scaled our client solutions. He was instrumental in designing and implementing the data science framework that powers our SaaS product, creating a robust foundation that continues to drive our technological capabilities and competitive advantage. His strategic approach to technology infrastructure and data architecture helped establish a solid foundation for our company's growth. As a fractional executive, he demonstrated remarkable ability to balance both high-level strategic planning and hands-on technical leadership.</i><br />

								<p><i>As a one-man business, I have to wear every hat to keep my company afloat. Well...ALMOST every hat...

									Thankfully, during my journey as an entrepreneur, I was lucky enough to meet Nick, who's essentially become my go-to guy for ANYTHING IT related. I've honestly lost track of how many times I've asked for his help (AND received EXACTLY what I needed in an absurdly speedy manner that made me feel like I was his biggest clientâ€”which I know can't possibly be true).
									
									Whether it's coding, website issues or even "user error" BS like spreadsheet issues (ðŸ˜‚), Nick has been there for me every single time, and he's been there for me in a hurry. Any business owner can attest to the power of "removing one hat," which Nick helps me feel seemingly on a daily basis!
									
									I can NOT recommend working with or at least knowing Nick enough. He's an IT wizard and a world-class human. If you don't know Nick, do yourself a favor and change that.</i><br />
